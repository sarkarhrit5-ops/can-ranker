# CAN-Ranker

> AI-Powered Candidate Discovery, Ranking & Evaluation System

## Overview

CAN-Ranker is an intelligent candidate ranking system designed to evaluate large candidate datasets against a given Job Description (JD) and identify the best-fit candidates through explainable, multi-factor scoring.

The system combines structured feature extraction, semantic matching, behavioral analysis, profile consistency validation, and weighted ranking to generate accurate and explainable candidate recommendations.

Designed with scalability in mind, CAN-Ranker efficiently processes large candidate datasets while remaining modular, configurable, and production-ready.

# Core Modules

### Candidate Parser

Efficiently loads and processes candidate data from large JSONL datasets.

### Feature Engineering

Extracts meaningful technical and professional attributes including:

- Skills
- Experience
- Career History
- Education
- Certifications
- Projects
- Behavioral Signals

### Consistency Engine

Evaluates profile consistency across multiple sections to identify conflicting or weakly supported information.

### Matching Engine

Measures candidate alignment with the target Job Description using semantic and structured analysis.

### Scoring Engine

Calculates a normalized ranking score by combining multiple evaluation factors into a single candidate score.

### Reasoning Engine

Generates concise, evidence-based explanations describing why a candidate received a particular ranking.

### Export Engine

Produces submission-ready CSV files compatible with downstream evaluation systems.
